# Changelog

## Known Issues
1. ~~Critical Sounds do not play for game systems that do not use the same roll logic as dnd5e~~ resolved in 0.7.6
2. Critical Sounds do not play when roll made with advantage/disadvantage
3. Critical Sounds ~~do~~ may not play with modules such as BetterRolls5e (possibly resolved in 0.7.6)
4. A GM must be logged in for many of the Maestro functions to work due to underlying Foundry permission requirements.

## [0.7.6] - 2021-10-03
### Item Tracks
- Improved the detection of token/actor and items in chat messages for Item Tracks
- Added a setting for the item-id attribute checked for in chat messages for Item Tracks
> These changes combined should greatly improve compatibility with different game systems
### Various
- Random playback option in Hype, Combat, Critical Success/Failure Tracks is now actually random again
- Playlist loop toggle can now only be seen/set by a GM which avoids an error that occurs when a non-GM tries to configure it
- When Hype/Combat Tracks pause sounds, they will now pause regardless of whether the playlist itself is marked as "playing"
### Hype Tracks
- When combat ends Hype Tracks will also end
- Hype Tracks correctly pause Combat Tracks
### Combat Tracks
- Combat Tracks now include a setting to pause other playlist sounds while they are playing. At the end of a Combat Track, the previously paused sounds should resume
- If there is a combat encounter the Combat Tracks config will open to the ENCOUNTER tab instead of DEFAULTS
### Critical Success/Failure Tracks
- Critical Success/Failure Tracks now include settings to configure the number of faces/die type (eg. 20 for d20) to trigger off and the threshold for success and failure
